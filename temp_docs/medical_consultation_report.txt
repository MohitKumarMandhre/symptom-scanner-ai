PATIENT'S SYMPTOMS:
==================================================
 I see a lot of small hairs on my head and there is a patch where the hair is not there.

==================================================
👨‍⚕️ MODERN MEDICINE ASSESSMENT:
==================================================
With what I see, I think you have alopecia areata, a condition that causes patchy hair loss due to an autoimmune response. I would suggest trying over-the-counter minoxidil solution to stimulate hair growth, and prescribing corticosteroids to reduce inflammation; in terms of lifestyle modifications, reducing stress and getting enough sleep can also help; if the condition worsens or doesn't improve, you should seek emergency care to rule out other underlying conditions; don't worry, this condition is treatable and often resolves on its own, so let's work together to address it and you'll likely see improvement.
