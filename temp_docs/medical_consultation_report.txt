👨‍⚕️ MODERN MEDICINE ASSESSMENT:
============================================================
With what I see, I think you have acne, which appears to be moderate to severe given the presence of multiple red patches and pimples on your face. I would recommend over-the-counter or prescription medications such as benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or retinoids to help control the acne, and lifestyle modifications like keeping your face clean, avoiding picking or popping pimples, and using non-comedogenic products; you should seek emergency care if you experience severe symptoms like difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or lips, or if your acne worsens; don't worry, acne is a common and treatable condition, and with proper treatment and care, you can get your skin under control and feel more confident.
