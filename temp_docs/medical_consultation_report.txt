👨‍⚕️ MODERN MEDICINE ASSESSMENT:
============================================================
With what I see, I think you have dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis, a common skin condition that causes flakes of dead skin, leading to white spots on your hair and scalp itchiness. You can try using an over-the-counter medicated shampoo containing ingredients like zinc pyrithione or ketoconazole to help control the condition, and consider making lifestyle modifications such as washing your hair regularly, reducing stress, and avoiding harsh hair products; if the symptoms persist or worsen, you should seek medical attention, but generally, this condition is manageable and I am confident you will feel better soon.
